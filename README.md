#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  Software engineering is the systematic approach to designing, developing, and maintaining reliable software systems. It applies engineering principles to ensure efficiency, scalability, and security.  
1. Ensures High-Quality Software – Reduces bugs and improves reliability through structured development and testing.  
2. Boosts Efficiency & Innovation – Uses Agile, DevOps, and automation to streamline development and drive new technologies.  
3. Enhances Security– Protects against cyber threats with secure coding and encryption.  
4. Supports Business Growth– Powers industries like e-commerce, healthcare, and finance, creating jobs and economic opportunities.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968) 
   - Introduced at the NATO Conference to address the "Software Crisis." 
   - Emphasized structured programming and formal development practices.  
2. The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s)
   - Introduced OOP concepts(encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism).  
   - Languages like C++, Java, and Python improved software scalability.  
3. Agile & Modern Development (2001–Present)
   - The Agile Manifesto (2001) shifted from rigid models to flexible, iterative development.  
   - DevOps, CI/CD, and cloud computing have accelerated software innovation.  


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Planning– Defines project goals and feasibility.  
2. Requirements Analysis – Gathers and documents user needs.  
3. Design – Creates system architecture and UI/UX.  
4. Implementation – Developers write and implement code.  
5. Testing– Identifies and fixes bugs before release.  
6. Deployment – Software is launched for users.  
7. Maintenance – Provides updates and bug fixes.  

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall: Ideal for structured projects like government or banking systems requiring strict regulations. (eg: Air traffic control software.)  
- Agile: Best for evolving products like web and mobile apps, where feedback-driven improvements are needed. (eg: E-commerce platform development.) 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer 
   - Writes, tests, and maintains code based on project requirements.  
   - Develops software features and integrates various system components.  
   - Collaborates with designers, QA engineers, and project managers to ensure smooth development.  
2. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer 
   - Designs and executes test cases to identify software defects.  
   - Ensures the product meets quality standards and user requirements.  
   - Works with developers to fix bugs and improve performance.  
3. Project Manager (PM)
   - Oversees project timelines, budgets, and deliverables.  
   - Coordinates team efforts and ensures communication between stakeholders.  
   - Manages risks and ensures the project meets its goals efficiently.  

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) 
   - Centralized platform for coding, debugging, and testing.  
   - Boosts productivity with features like auto-completion and error detection.  
   - eg VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm.  

2. Version Control Systems (VCS)
   - Tracks code changes, enables collaboration, and prevents data loss.  
   - Supports branching and merging for parallel development.  
   - eg Git (with GitHub/GitLab), SVN.  


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Debugging & Fixing Bugs  
   - Challenge: Identifying and resolving code errors can be time-consuming.  
   - Solution: Use debugging tools, write clean code, and perform regular testing.  
2. Keeping Up with New Technologies  
   - Challenge: Rapid advancements make it hard to stay updated.  
   - Solution: Engage in continuous learning through courses, tech blogs, and coding communities.  
3. Meeting Deadlines 
   - Challenge: Tight project timelines can lead to stress and rushed coding.  
   - Solution: Use Agile methodologies, set realistic goals, and prioritize tasks effectively.  
4. Collaboration & Communication  
   - Challenge: Miscommunication can cause project delays and misunderstandings.  
   - Solution:Use collaboration tools (Slack, Jira) and hold regular team meetings.  
5. Security & Data Protection 
   - Challenge:Preventing cyber threats and vulnerabilities.  
   - Solution: Follow secure coding practices, conduct security audits, and use encryption.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing – Tests individual components to ensure they function correctly (e.g., login function).  
2. Integration Testing– Checks if modules work together properly (e.g., login system connecting to a database).  
3. System Testing – Evaluates the entire system for functionality (e.g., testing an e-commerce site).  
4. Acceptance Testing – Ensures the software meets user requirements before deployment.  


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining input prompts to effectively communicate with AI models and achieve desired responses. It involves structuring queries, providing context, and using specific wording to optimize AI-generated outputs.  

1. Enhances AI Accuracy– Well-crafted prompts improve the relevance and precision of responses.  
2. Improves Efficiency – Reduces trial and error by guiding AI to generate useful results faster.  
3. Expands AI Capabilities – Allows users to get creative and extract more nuanced insights.  
4. Optimizes AI for Different Use Cases – Tailored prompts help AI excel in tasks like coding, writing, and problem-solving.  


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about technology."  
Improved Prompt:  
"Explain AI’s impact on healthcare, including benefits and challenges." 

Why It’s Better?  
- More Specific – Focuses on AI in healthcare.  
- Clear Expectations – Requests both benefits and challenges.  
- Concise & Direct – Reduces ambiguity for a precise response.
